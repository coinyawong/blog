비트코인에 대한 사토시의 초기 비전은 혁명적이었습니다. 
국가를 초월하고, 불신과 인플레이션을 넘어서는 글로벌 통화로써
비트코인은 금융 시장을 핵심으로 삼아야했습니다. 하지만 그 비전은 실패했습니다.
분산화의 새로운 시대를 열어주는 대신에 비트코인 가치 그 자체로 집중되었기 때문입니다. 권력은 3개의 채굴 풀로 집중되었습니다. 
트랜젝션 속도는 몇 시간으로 늦어졌으며, 수수료는 현재 40달러 수준으로 급등했습니다.
현재, 비트코인은 P2P(Peer-to-peer) 디지털 자산으로써 분산화를 보장하지 않는다는 것이 분명해졌습니다.

스카이코인이 이를 해결할 수 있습니다. 지난 5년 간, 스카이코인 프로젝트의 연구/개발팀은
기존 Pow/Pos 알고리즘을 개선하기 위한 혁신적인 방법을 찾기 위해 지속적으로 노력했습니다.
스카이코인의 새로운 합의 알고리즘은 네트워크 제어 권한을 사용자들에게 부여해줍니다.
이것은 사토시의 초기 비전으로 되돌아가서, 지금의(구) 뱅킹 시스템을 대체할 암호화화폐의 
대량 유통을 위한 새로운 길을 여는 것입니다.

The unique features of Skycoin set it apart from other cryptocurrencies. Unlike most recent
coins, Skycoin has its own blockchain, consensus algorithm, and developers. Skycoin is not an
Ethereum ERC20 token. It’s a third-generation cryptocurrency based on the brand-new consensus
framework Obelisk. Skycoin uses Obelisk to decentralize transaction processing and approval.

Skycoin’s revolutionary consensus algorithm lets transactions happen in seconds, not hours.
This eliminates the performance gap between blockchain-based payments and centralized credit
card networks. With zero transaction fees and lightning-fast speed, Skycoin represents the
first viable alternative to centralized banking. It’s poised to do what Bitcoin couldn’t:
transform the financial world for everyone across the globe.

## Digital Gold: No Deflation

Satoshi designed Bitcoin to protect wealth from inflation. Bitcoin is an immutable currency,
with a finite supply capped at 21 million. By capping the number of Bitcoins that can exist,
Satoshi hoped to create digital gold: he wanted to provide a premium investment that could
return value over the years.

Unfortunately, Bitcoin had a flaw. Miners could receive new coins through the mechanism of
block reward. The newly-created coins caused inflation, and control centralized into one or
two large mining pools. The effect was a monopoly that destroyed the equalizing potential of
Bitcoin.

Skycoin eliminates this flaw. Like Bitcoin, Skycoin is an immutable currency with an issuance
capped at 100 million. But unlike Bitcoin, Skycoin features a redesigned consensus mechanism
that removes the block reward. This change has profound consequences for users.

Without the block reward, miners have no incentive to monopolize and control the Skycoin
network for personal gain. Skycoin’s design prevents the monopolization that persists in
Bitcoin and Ethereum. By eliminating block reward, Skycoin prevents inflation and provides a
more perfect “digital gold.”

Skycoin also eliminates transaction fees. Like block rewards, transaction fees plague other
cryptocurrencies by creating monetary incentives. Miners strive to push up fees at the cost
of the network. With no fees or block rewards, Skycoin offers an investment that can benefit
all users fairly.

When Skycoin users make transactions, they spend Coin Hours, not Skycoin. Coin Hours are
shares of network resources that work like dividends. A user receives one Coin Hour for each
hour they hold a Skycoin. The dividend pays out when Coin Hours are traded at exchange rates.
100 million new Coin Hours are created each hour, and each transaction must burn a minimum of
50% of its Coin Hour inputs. This creates scarcity and limits the number of Coin Hours in
circulation to an equilibrium value. Through the Coin Hour system, Skycoin provides network
transactions that prevent inflation and support fair use.
